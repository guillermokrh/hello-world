Hello this is a new readme file that I have created
on the hello-world git folder in my directory.

I am modifying this text file so that I can get further practice with vim and github!

Starting to look like those hackers that I find in Starbucks with their terminals and lattes. 

I am now going to try to use the git diff command, so I need to try modifiying a file and then staging it.  

I am changing a currently tracked file so that I can see what that looks like on github.  I am excited to continue my CleryDart app soon.

trying to reber if i remember basic vim commands
